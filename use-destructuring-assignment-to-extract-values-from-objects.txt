// Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};
//const today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
//const tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;

const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

console.log({today, tomorrow}); //if I add yesterday, it results in error
//therefore it proves that it displays the variables that are outside the object.
